# CPU & Disk Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

This Java Swing desktop application simulates various CPU and Disk Scheduling algorithms. Users can input process details like arrival time and burst time, and the application will display results through Gantt charts, tables, and final metrics such as Average Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, etc.

## Features

- **Algorithms Supported:**
  - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job Next (SJN)
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Disk Scheduling Algorithms (e.g., FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, C-LOOK)

- **Input Parameters:**
  - Arrival Time
  - Burst Time
  - Priority (for priority scheduling)
  - Time Quantum (for Round Robin)
  
- **Outputs:**
  - Gantt Chart
  - Tabular Display of Execution Order
  - Calculation of Average Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, etc.

- **User Interface:**
  - Interactive and user-friendly GUI using Java Swing.
  - Easy input and clear output representation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
